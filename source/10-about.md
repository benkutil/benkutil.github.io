**Hi, my name is Ben.** I’m a systems-obsessed product designer who codes, teaches, and bakes.

I operate [Make Things Studio](http://make-things.com), an interactive consultancy working with businesses, non-profits, and schools to define & realize business goals on the web.

You can [read the rest of my resumé](/about/resume/), or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benkutil).

My teaching emphasizes a people-centered design process, the importance of business in design, and the wide breadth of knowledge needed as a product designer.

Baking bread clicks with my love of process. Starting from the same four ingredients, slight tweaks to my process can create different outcomes. Baguettes versus a boule, sour versus earthy. I’m drawn to baking by possibilities created by those four ingredients, and the impact that changes in the process can have on those outcomes.

You should follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benkutil) and [instagram](https://instagram.com/benkutil).
