            Mike, I’m applying for the [Product Manager](https://zapier.com/jobs/product-manager-spring-2016/) position with Zapier. I thought an email was a little limiting and I wouldn’t want you to go over your data plan downloading attachments! I’ve included answers to your prompts below.

            I like helping people. I think the fulfillment I get from seeing other people succeed has directed my path through life.
    -   body: Right now, I’m helping my 2&frac12; year old daughter Afton, and 11 month old son Tippett learn and understand their abilities and emotions.

                The happiest, funniest baby I know.
    -   body: My wife Katie and I also have two dogs, Cole and Dillon, both rescue dogs from the [local shelter](/designs/mdspca). We think Cole has a mix of Pitbull, Chow, and Newfoundland. Dillon mixes Shepherd with Rottweiler. He lets Afton and Tippett crawl all over him, and I feel lucky they have Cole and Dillon in their life.

            I’ve [worked independently](http://make-things.com) for the past 8 years, helping clients achieve their goals through websites and applications. I’ve enjoyed the variety of projects self employment has given me. I feel thankful to work from home, having as much time with my family as possible. If I had to work from an office, I’d miss so much of my children’s life.

            I’ve lived in Baltimore, Maryland since 2000, when I moved here to attend the Maryland Institute College of Art. We live on a quiet street behind a historic water tower. I love the [peregrine falcons that live in the tower](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fizkiks/albums/72157634105376238). I was able to get close enough to a young one last summer to some great pictures.

            For the past 7 years, I’ve taught in the [Graphic Design department](http://micagraphicdesign.org) of my alma mater, [Maryland Institute College of Art](https://www.mica.edu). I focus on the foundations of interactive design, typography for screens, and modern front-end development techniques. My students have gone on to work at Atlassian, Dropbox, Facebook, Mapbox, and The New York Times.

            Having a positive impact on a student, helping them get a job, launch their own website, and seeing understanding blossom onto their face gives me great satisfaction.

            I enjoy cooking, baking, and biking. In the past years, I’ve focused on perfecting my bread baking process. After working all day at a screen, using my hands to create something has meditative qualities. I’ve toyed with starting a bread delivery service, called bk_ry, but right now I use it as a [hashtag to keep track of my baking](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bk_ry/). A couple weeks ago I made Old Fashioned doughnuts.

            - **[Roadmap](https://ppmroadmap.com)**, a project management and resource forecasting tool. I gathered customer research, defined requirements, created mockups & prototypes, worked with developers to <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> features before release, answer support tickets after launch, and market the features to current & future clients.
            - **[Odometer](https://time.ppmroadmap.com)** tracks time for Roadmap. I helped to pick Ember as the development platform, developed an MVP, ran testing sessions, designed mockups, wrote SCSS and Ember components, setup continuous deployment & servers, and establish a beta testing program.
            - **[Roadmap for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roadmap/kocnlcjmilagfcojemhbijcjphhlbini?hl=en)**, a Chrome extension that allows customers to use Roadmap from within the apps they use most. Integrates with Basecamp, Github, and Jira. Helped to define requirements, design mockups and gather customer feedback.

            In the summer of 2015, Roadmap and Home Depot partnered to develop four features important to Home Depot’s day-to-day business operations. I feel this project represents my skills and process as a Product Manager.

            The conversation started with a support ticket from Home Depot. The features Home Depot needed aligned with long term product goals, but Roadmap didn't have resources to execute on them right now. Roadmap has used customer funded development as a way to bootstrap the business and pull features “forward” in the product pipeline.

            We started with a high-level estimate of the features that we could deliver to Home Depot. I worked with the CEO and CTO to build a design estimate that I felt comformtable with. We structured our proposal to have an initial design effort, and then a more detailed proposal for development costs.

            alt: Example of our estimate for Home Depot
    -   body: |
            With the proposal accepted, I used Basecamp to collaborate with Home Depot, setting up a timeline of reviews for the four main products.

            Through Google Hangouts, we held a series of sketch sessions to help define customer flow through the new features. Low resolution sketching made iterating easy.

                Home Depot and I followed [Basecamp’s lead](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/466-sketching-with-a-sharpie) and sketched with thick markers our concepts for user flow and features on page. Here you can see sketches for the creation of project templates and custom notifications.
    -   body: |
            Once we came to consensus on features and flow from our sketching session, I designed mockups and created click-through prototypes to confirm our decisions with Home Depot and other customers. I used [Intercom](https://intercom.io) to message a specific sub-set of our customers who would have interest in these features.

                I mocked up the interfaces using Sketch. These screens represent the userflow for creating and editing a new project template. [Click through the prototype](/media/portfolio/roadmap-project-templates) I shared with Home Depot and customers.
    -   body: |
            After I reviewed the mockups with Home Depot, I had a series of Hangouts with our development team, based in Ukraine. From those hangouts, we refined our requirements using Confluence.

            image: applications/zapier/home-depot-requirements.jpg
            alt: Requirements I wrote in Confluence
            caption: We used Confluence as a way to collaborate on feature requirements.
    -   body: |
            Those requirements then became issues in Github, organized by Milestone. Roadmap integrates with Github, allowing us to track our progress on Roadmap in Roadmap.
        figure:
            image: applications/zapier/home-depot-issues.jpg
            alt: Example of Github Issue
            caption: All feature issues followed the same general template of **Need**, **Scenario**, **Todo**, **Effort**, **Files**, and **Notes**. Our development team appreciated the consistency and level of detail.
    -   body: |
            Features rolled out in waves, and we planned to release a new part of the feature every 2 weeks. This process worked well, and allowed us to mitigate some large infrastructure issues we ran into. As we enabled features, we used Intercom to message customers.
    -   callout: |
            Working collaboratively with Home Depot, engaged customers, and developers, I led the creation of Roadmap’s new project templates, custom notifications, project dependencies, and collision reports.

            Mike, thanks for the opportunity to share my experiences, and I look forward to discussing the position and how I can help shape Zapier’s future.  I believe I exceed the qualifications you’re looking for in the position. I’ve managed product development, help others to succeed, prefer remote work, and believe in pragmatic design.
