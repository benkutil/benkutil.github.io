    Do design tests provide insight into an applicant’s thought process, provide free work, or devalue the portfolio?

I haven’t applied for a job since 2004. A lot has changed since then, and working to reenter the fulltime workforce has had ups and downs.

I’ve seen [engineering tests](https://github.com/search?utf8=✓&q=hiring+test), but haven’t seen design tests as publicly available. Often, these engineering tests seem to focus on high level concepts, process, and problem solving. These qualities seem as important when hiring a designer.

In the past, I would have answered those questions during an interview, while talking through a portfolio. When applying for internships and my first jobs out of college, we talked about the concepts, process, and problems behind a project.

I feel conflicted about the widespread adoption of a design test. How do they relate or fit into the continuum of spec work. How does a design test differ from a portfolio piece if no discussion takes place for either? What role does payment play in a design test? Do applicants have any other option?

This job application process still feels new to me, and it seems everyone has a slightly different “test” process. I put together a few other’s experiences as well.

Some good reading on design tests.

Thanks to people like [Julie Zhou](https://medium.com/@joulee), [Google Ventures](https://library.gv.com), and others, a large body of writing exists around product and design management. How can we standardize the hiring process like we’ve tried to standardize product management and managing designers. Can we create a service or checklist like joblint.org to help employers and applicants better evaluate a design test.
