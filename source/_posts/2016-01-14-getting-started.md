My story sounds familiar. Make some New Years resolutions with good intentions,
then promptly forget about them, or, allow them to nag in the back of your mind
as you push it off to the “next day”.

I needed to create a personal website. I’ve thought about doing it since November.
I had no problem finding excuses not to work on it.

I could say the same about baking bread. I enjoy doing it, but had found excuses not to.

So I’ve started today, with a simple site, and a new starter.

In the past, I’ve followed Chad Robertson’s starter process from his [Country Bread recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016277-tartines-country-bread). This time, I’ve [used a recipe](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9qinzbju8ihqy22/AADvBda8-wy6Otxq73_nNlvNa/GET%20STARTER'ED.pdf?dl=0) from [@apieceofbread](https://instagram.com/apieceofbread). He has also put all of his [bread formulae up on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9qinzbju8ihqy22/AACjVcSIkHGDAAPQTRClXsjya?dl=0).

## Bread Formulae

I find bread so interesting because at its simplest, it consists of flour, water, time, and heat. A starter makes use of all of those ingredients. In the beginning, you “feed” or replenish a starter on a daily basis. During that day, you want to keep you starter between 86°F and 104°F. My house does not get that warm, so my starter hangs out on top of my Mac Pro. The exhaust of my computer hovers around 100°F.

Bread recipes represent all other ingredients as percentages of the total flour weight.

In the case of this starter, you begin with `100% Flour`, and `200% Water`. That means, if you began with `30g flour`, you would use `60g water`.

### Refreshment 0

```
100% Flour (whole grain)
200% Water

Time: 24h

```

### Refreshment 1

```
100% Flour (whole grain)
300% Starter

Time: 24h
Goal Temp: 35°C, or 95°F
```

### Future Refreshments

Some people like wet starters, and some people like dry starters. That’s why the variation in water percentages.

```
100% Flour (whole grain)
50% — 300% Water
20% Starter
```
