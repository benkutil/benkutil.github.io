    - body: Odometer works as a companion application for Roadmap, making it easier for individual contributors to keep track of their time. Project Managers rely on those time entries to provide an accurate look at future schedules, budgets, and resource use.

        At the time, Roadmap’s development debt acted as a major roadblock for quick delivery of features to customers, and designers could not touch the codebase.

        We chose to build a companion application to Roadmap. This would allow us to leave Roadmap’s legacy code by the wayside, work iteratively, and define processes that we could when redeveloping the primary application.

        body: |-
            I acted as Product Manager and Designer, allowing me to guide features from conception to implemention in Ember, our chosen front-end framework.

            I configured servers and setup a continuous integration process.

            As we released features, I organized our beta testing program to work with existing customers to incorporate their feedback into the next iteration.

                The current iteration of the application organizes your tasks by due date, putting important tasks front and center.

                We prioritized clarity over convenience in the new design language. Even the hover state placeholder text had different placeholder text to inform customers what action they could expect.
