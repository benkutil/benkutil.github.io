<!-- - Resource forecasting and planning tool
- capital constrained company
- re-design entire application in a month

- MVP lived for too long
- Inconsistent design implementation
- Customers couldn’t find features

- Incorporating customer feedback using tools like intercom and invision
- Categorized features by stakeholder
- Structured application based on goals or "jobs" a customer needs to do
- Mobile first explorations
- Flexible design system -->
