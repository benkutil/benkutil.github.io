            After a month of design sprints, I took apart a zombie “MVP” app, reorganizing and redesigning the application around two guiding principles.

            I consulted with Roadmap off and on since 2010. As the application grew more and more complex, I knew it needed a comprehensive redesign of the application.

            Roadmap, as a bootstrapped company, didn’t have the resources to take on a full redesign. They continued to add features to the original MVP, pushing it beyond a typical app lifecycle.

            Over the years, this created inconsistencies that hindered the usability of the app. Combined with application instabilities, customers lost confidence that they could complete their tasks in Roadmap.

            I came back to the project in 2015 to address this crisis.
    -   heading: Guiding Principles
        body: |
            Before the first design sprint, I put together “guiding principles” for the design and development of the application. These principles followed a _positive_ over _positive_ format, representing the attributes the application would put first. During the first meeting, we settled on two guiding principles for the application.

            ### Clarity Over Convenience

            The customer should understand the content, context, status and actions available to them.

            ### Insight Over Analytics

            A customer should understand the meaning and importance of the datapoints Roadmap provides to them.

            I used these principles with the design team and in product meetings as a filter for our critiques.

<!-- - Resource forecasting and planning tool
- capital constrained company
- re-design entire application in a month

- MVP lived for too long
- Inconsistent design implementation
- Customers couldn’t find features

- Incorporating customer feedback using tools like intercom and invision
- Categorized features by stakeholder
- Structured application based on goals or "jobs" a customer needs to do
- Mobile first explorations
- Flexible design system -->
