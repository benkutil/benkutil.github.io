            Roomtag’s space management software had a robust feature set with poor usability and a spreadsheet interface. I took stock of the powerful features, talked with power users and prospective users, and re-organized the application around a simplified set of actions customers needed most.

            caption: I created an interface concept for navigating floorplans across a company’s different buildings. Here, the navigation still mirrored their original flat & wide architecture.

            alt: Searching for a person’s locations within a company
            caption: I re-organized the navigation around the people, spaces, and assets that make up a company. The faceted search tool I introduced gave customers quick access to any data point.

            caption: Faceted search allows customers to get specific with their search queries, which they can save for quick recall of information.

            caption: Roomtag built a floorplan navigator for visual exploration and work within a building’s floors.

            caption: Customers made it clear that having an audit log and roll backs helped them feel confident in their work, and provided the oversight needed in some corporate environments.

            I found customers either had space planning, or asset tracking tasks, but they did not do both those tasks at the same time. I worked with Roomtag to move their asset tracking functionality into a separate service.

            alt: Roomtag’s asset management tools became a stand alone application.
            caption: Roomtag’s stand along asset management tool made it easy to intake, track, and deploy assets across a company.

            caption: I updated the dashboard to display the key metrics Roomtag’s customers had the most interest in day-to-day.
    -   callout: By focusing on jobs customers try to complete, I re-organized one large application into two effective tools, with innovative features for exploring how companies use their space.
    -   body: Asure Software acquired Roomtag in 2014 for $1.7 million. The application I designed lives on as&nbsp;[Asure&nbsp;Smartmove](http://www.asuresoftware.com/products/smartmove/).
