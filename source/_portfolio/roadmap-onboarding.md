            I worked with Roadmap to create three personas focused around the pain points that Roadmap solved. I created these personas after interviewing current customers using [Intercom](https://intercom.io), Survey Monkey, and a series of phone interviews.

            - ###Spreadsheet Jockey

                Most project management customers used spreadsheets before finding Roadmap, copying and pasting dates and assignements across sheets or documents. Roadmap gives these managers a consolidated view of the people and projects they manage.
            - ###Status Meeting Star

                Most Roadmap customers had someone that they report too. Through the interview process, I learned that creating reports and documents for the “higher ups” took up precious time in their week.
            - ###Talented at Tabbing

                The details of today’s projects exist across services. Client communication in one tool, developers working in another. Project managers often have to jump between different services to get the whole view of a project. Roadmap has the unique capability of connecting across multipe tools, and combining that information into one project stream. This way, project managers could work in Roadmap, and other project contributors could work in theirs.
