Odometer works as a companion application for Roadmap, making it easier for individual contributors to keep track of their time. Project Managers rely on those time entries to provide an accurate look at future schedules, budgets, and resource use.

## Building Roadmap’s Future Today

At the time, Roadmap’s development debt acted as a major roadblock for quick delivery of features to customers, and designers could not touch the codebase.

We chose to build a companion application to Roadmap. This would allow us to leave Roadmap’s legacy code by the wayside, work iteratively, and define processes that we could when redeveloping the primary application.

## Bringing My Skills to Bear

I acted as Product Manager and Designer, allowing me to guide features from conception to implemention in Ember, our chosen front-end framework. I configured servers and setup a continuous integration process. As we released features, I organized our beta testing program to work with existing customers to incorporate their feedback into the next iteration.

<!-- - Development platform made it difficult to release new features
- built on old technology
- untouchable by designers

- Roadmap works best with accurate data. Actual time useful
- Existing time tracking interface was inconsistent and difficult
- Who likes tracking time

- Fast design & development cycles that we could test with customers
- Iterated on Features

- Designed as timer first, customer feedback focused on tracking historical time
- Released updates every week
- Planned, Designed, and implemented design for all features -->
