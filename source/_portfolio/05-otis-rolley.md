            Otis Rolley represented a new politician for Baltimore. Without the political baggage of other elected officials, Otis’s platform focused on job creation & economic growth, improving education, increasing neighborhood safety, neighborhood revitalization, and rebuilding government.

            I used Otis’s city planner background as inspiration for his branding, giving a nod to the Ravens fans by tweaking the typical blueprint color towards purple. Otis’s typeface was geometric, strong, and read well at all scales.

            The campaign worked with a political consulting firm to build the first iteration of the website, but it lacked the attention and impact needed to stand out. I created a flexible design system for the main website, and individual issue landing pages.

            Throughout the campaign, I got to explore designing for new environments. Whether buses & bus stops, building signage & billboards, or traditional collateral packages, we touched on every medium.

    -   callout: Otis’s campaign stood apart from the competition with a design platform that reinforced his plans for improving Baltimore’s&nbsp;future.
