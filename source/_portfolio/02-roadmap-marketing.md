intro: >
    Roadmap had a confusing website focused on&nbsp;features. I&nbsp;simplified its call to action, and developed a content strategy based on impact, not&nbsp;features.

            I worked with Roadmap to focus their website on customer impact, not a list of features. I took a complex and confusing site that lacked a direct call to action, and streamlined it into four concise pages.

            After A/B testing, I found that having one strong call to action on the homepage worked best for conversions.

            I organized the content of the landing page around four action words – **Visualize**, **Align**, **Forecast**, and **Manage**. I matched features and customer testimonials to those action words, providing a snappy introduction to Roadmap.

            Through a simple content strategy and direct implementation, I created a responsive marketing platform that boosted conversions and provided a solid foundation for a redesigned onboarding experience and application design.
