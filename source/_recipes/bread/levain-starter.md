    Some people like wet starters, and some people like dry starters.
    That’s why the variation in water percentages.


    Keep track of your starter’s hydration level. If you have 100% water and 100% flour, that’s 100% hydration. When determining the amount of flour to use for refreshment, you start with the amount
    of flour in your starter, and multiply by a factor of 5-20. Lower values
    are better for cold environment, and higher values better for warmer environments.


    #### For Example

    If your house is 66°, and you have 50g of 100% hydrated starter, you’d multiply
    25 times 5, for 125g of flour. You could then add the appropriate amount of water
    for the hydration level you prefer.

### Example Schedule

I’ve followed this schedule for the past couple of weeks. I keep my house’s temperature around 68°. I start my dough Friday afternoon, let it bulk rise through the evening, shape before bed, and proof overnight in the fridge.

1.  <h4>Day 1 (Refreshment 0)</h4>

    ```
    100% Flour:     100g
    200% Water:     200g
    ```
2.  <h4>Day 2 (Refreshment 1)</h4>

    ```
    100% Flour:     50g
    300% Starter:   150g
    ```
3.  <h4>Day 3–7 (Refreshment 2)</h4>

    ```
    100% Flour:     100g
    100% Water:     100g
    20% Starter:    20g
    ```
4.  <h4>Morning of mixing</h4>

    ```
    100% Flour: 250g
    100% Water: 250g
    20% Starter: 50g;
    ```
