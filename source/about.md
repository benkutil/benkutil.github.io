# Hi, my name is Ben

A systems-obsessed product designer who codes, teaches, and bakes.

I operate Make Things Studioâ„¢, an interactive consultancy working with
businesses, non-profits, and schools to define & realize business
goals on the web.

My teaching emphasizes a people-centered design process, the importance of business in design, and the wide breadth of knowledge needed as a product designer.

Bread baking clicks with my love of process. Starting from the same four ingredients, slight tweaks to my process create different outcomes. Baguettes versus a boule, sour versus earthy. The importance of process draws me to baking.
