Thereâ€™s the concept of [working software over comprehensive requirements](https://agilemanifesto.org). Tonight, I was happy to have a little bit of extra documentation to go along side my working software.

Tonight, I updated the basic text and link colors. I intend to keep them inline with the colors on the [current site](https://2016.benkutil.com). I found these helpful variables in that codebase:

```css
$color1: #ffb222; //rgba(255, 178, 34, 100)
$color2: #d72c66; //rgba(215, 44, 102, 100)
$color3: #882c62; //rgba(136, 44, 98, 100)
```
So happy that I included those rgba values ðŸ™„. 

But, I had a comment with a [link to the scheme on Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffb222-d72c66-882c62-4e2c20-4e9f75). Now those `$color` variables made sense! 

I had watched [this talk from Merlin Mann in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsjQrziback) earlier today. Both share a similar concept: act smart today to work mindlessly in the future. I could have named my variables to describe their role. Or write tasks with actionable information.

## Accomplishments

1. Gave `<a>` tags a fancy little `transition`.
2. Remembered the `L, V, H, A` order for anchor pseudo-classes.
2. Updated post markup.

## Time check
I worked from 9:15â€“10:00p, while drinking a [Lawsonâ€™s Sip of Sunshine](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17980/117177/).
