## Things I looked up
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)  
I’m using [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) to work with GitHub on iPad. I no longer have a personal computer, and I’d like to experiment with keeping it that way. I miss having my custom [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) theme.
- [_drafts | Deploy a Jekyll Site with GitHub Actions (v2)](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/github-actions2.html) and [appleboy/scp-action: GitHub Action that copy files and artifacts via SSH.](https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action)  
Since I no longer have a personal computer, I’d like to use the robots on the internet to help build and deploy this site.  
I setup [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to deploy my site, and it worked very well. Point-and-click setup. I missed having an actual server though, and will continue to use the Digital Ocean droplet that I have.  
I tested using GitHub Actions to build and deploy my site. So far, [it works as expected, and isn’t very sophisticated](https://github.com/benkutil/benkutil.github.io/blob/develop/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml). 


## Things I did
- Copy and paste code into a [GitHub actions yaml file](https://github.com/benkutil/benkutil.github.io/blob/develop/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml).

## Next
- further automate deployments
- Work on domain. `2020.benkutil.com` went out of date pretty quickly.
