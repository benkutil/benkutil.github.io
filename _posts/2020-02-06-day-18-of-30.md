Yesterday, I tested the certificate setup using [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=benkutil.com). I felt sad to find out, I got a **B**. Since 2016, seems we’ve moved passed TLS 1.1, and matured SPDY to HTTP/2.

My Digital Ocean droplet has gotten stuck in a wierd state where I can’t upgrade packages. `dpkg` errors out saying that it `cannot allocate memory`. Because I can’t upgrade nginx, I could only configure TLS 1.2. At least I moved off 1.1 before browsers gave up support for it.

Yesterday I overwite the files of [benkutil.com](https://benkutil.com). I had symlinked all the server directories to the same folder and hadn’t realized it. 

## Accomplishments

1. Updated `nginx` configs to use TLS 1.2 and HTTP/2. [Retested on SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=benkutil.com).
2. Reverted files on [benkutil.com](https://benkutil.com).
3. Setup jekyll build action on GitHub.

## Things I’ve learned
- I miss automated deployments.

## What I’m working on next
- automated deployments using GitHub actions

## Time check
I worked from 9–9:45p, while watching Project Runway.
