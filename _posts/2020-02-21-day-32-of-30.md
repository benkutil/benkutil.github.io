The fact that it’s day 32 of my 30 day project is telling. Matches other habits I had tried to build. I've had one book on my nightstand for weeks. Haven't made it past page 100. Drinking beer. Missing lunch. Staying up late. How easy to slide back into an old routine.

But! Here I am. I want to continue this habit. I’ll drop the “30 days of website” part. But writing. Remembering CSS. I’m looking forward to continuing that.

## Accomplishments

1. I wrote this post.

## Things I’ve learned
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) has great text manipulation tools. I’ve been using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) for note taking, and I miss the controls of Sublime Text.
- I want all my text in monospace.
- I think I like [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

## What I’m working on next
- Considering moving off Digital Ocean… or at least re-creating my droplet.


## Time check
I worked from 8:45–9:10p, while drinking a [Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/140/317146/) and reading twitter.
