I am the Chief Technology Officer for [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team). Over my 9 years at Ad Hoc, I've had the opportunity to define strategy, build services, lead teams, and coach people.

My leadership extends outside of work as President of the [Cumberland Valley Collective](https://cvc.bike) (CVC) Bike Racing team, board member for Franklin County Cyclists, and Co-Race Director for the Michaux GRVL event.
