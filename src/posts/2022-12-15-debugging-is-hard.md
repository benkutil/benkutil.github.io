Tonight, I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why something wasn’t working. Found out that the package I used had an issue in its **core functionality**. And it wasn’t actively maintained.
Thankful someone had [forked and fixed](https://github.com/sentience/eleventy-xml-plugin) the issue.
Anyways. I don’t miss this part of programming.
