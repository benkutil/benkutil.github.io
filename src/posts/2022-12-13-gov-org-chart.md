From a person’s point of view, we're still “shipping the org chart” of government agencies. 
Sure we’ve improved the experience of those online experiences. And have tried to structure them around verbs and the way people think. But people still need to find out what benefi they need. And what agency offers it.
It's taken us 10 years to get consistent on creating good government websites.
How long will it take us to abstract the org chart of government from people’s day to day?
