As an adult, kids Christmas lists are boring. It does make giving a “gift” easier. It removes all the thought and care that makes it a “gift”. Even more if you get them all from Amazon. Point, click, buy. Love Dad/Uncle Ben.
I think next year I’ll go rougue. No lists, only vibes and care and interest. Watch out kids.
