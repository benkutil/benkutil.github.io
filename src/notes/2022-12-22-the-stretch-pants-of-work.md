I’ve arrived late to the "joggers" game. I purchased two pairs in a effort to not have to change from jeans into sweatpants when trying to work out durring the day.

Since then, I can’t get out of them. I’ve given up. Super comfortable. Convient for moving around. I’ve hit a new low.

The last couple of weeks at work, we’ve talked about the need for a bit higher standards when it comes to meetings and communications.

As we’ve accepted lower expecatations about appearance, have we also accepted lower expectations when it comes to agendas, action items, and communicating status?
